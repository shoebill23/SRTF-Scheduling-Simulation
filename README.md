# SRTF-Scheduling-Simulation
This project implements a CPU scheduler based on the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithm, designed to minimize waiting times by dynamically prioritizing tasks with the least remaining burst time. The solution is provided in two distinct forms to demonstrate different architectural perspectives which implement single and multi threading
